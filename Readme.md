# Library App

This project is a simple **Library App** built using **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **JavaScript** for functionality. The app allows users to add books to their personal library by filling out a form that asks for details like the **book title**, **author**, **number of pages**, and whether the book has been read. The data is stored locally on the user's device using **Local Storage**, so the library persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add new books to the library by filling out a form.
- Fields include:
  - **Book Title**: The title of the book.
  - **Author**: The author of the book.
  - **Number of Pages**: How many pages the book has.
  - **Read Status**: Whether or not the user has read the book.
- Books are displayed in a cards format with their details.
- Data is saved in **Local Storage**, allowing users to retain their library between sessions.
